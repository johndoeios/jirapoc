            const statusId = issue.fields.status?.id || "";
            const sprintField = issue.fields.customfield_10104 || [];
            const storyPoint = issue.fields.customfield_10102 || 0;
            const epicKey = issue.fields.customfield_10106 || null; // We check this for "Unassigned EPIC"
            const statusName = issue.fields.status?.name || "Unknown Status";
